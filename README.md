# A simple decentralized dynamic Fundraising contract 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a simple fundraising  contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat test --network goerli
yarn hardhat deploy
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/fund.js
```
